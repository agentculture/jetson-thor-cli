"""Unit tests for the privileged swap-grow executor in :mod:`jetson_thor.swap.apply`.

These exercise the SAFETY-CRITICAL guard logic — the root check, the ``--apply``
gate, and abort-on-failure — without ever running a real swap command or
requiring root. A fake runner records every ``(name, args)`` it is asked to run,
and a fake ``geteuid`` simulates root / non-root, so the tests assert *which*
mutating commands would (or would not) have fired by inspecting the recorder.

GrowPlan inputs are built from the real planner (:func:`build_grow_plan`) fed a
hand-built ``state`` dict, keeping these tests honest against the actual plan
shape rather than a hand-faked one.
