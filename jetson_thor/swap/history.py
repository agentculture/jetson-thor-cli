"""Per-process memory/swap history: a bounded JSONL store + sampler.

``thor swap`` needs to answer "what has been eating RAM/swap lately?" without a
running daemon and without an external time-series database. This module is the
storage layer behind that: :func:`record` samples ``/proc/<pid>/status`` once
and appends one JSONL line per process; :func:`query` aggregates the recent
window into a top-N ranking. Pure stdlib (the zero-runtime-dependency rule), and
everything is injectable (``now``, ``store_dir``, ``proc_root``) so the sampler
is hermetically testable.

Storage layout (under :func:`default_store_dir`, i.e.
``$XDG_STATE_HOME/jetson-thor``)::

    proc-history.jsonl      active file, appended to
    proc-history.jsonl.1    the single previous rotation

JSONL line schema (one line per process per snapshot)::

    {"ts": float, "pid": int, "comm": str, "rss_kb": int, "swap_kb": int}

Bounded retention / the rotation invariant
-------------------------------------------
The store is *self-pruning*: it can never grow without bound. The active file is
kept at or below ``max_bytes``. When an append would push it over ``max_bytes``,
the active file is rotated to ``proc-history.jsonl.1`` (overwriting the single
previous rotation — at most ONE rotation is retained) and a fresh active file is
started. :func:`query` reads across the active file and the one rotation.

Documented cap: total bytes across active + rotation never exceed
``2 * max_bytes`` (= ``(rotations + 1) * max_bytes`` with ``rotations == 1``),
*provided a single snapshot fits within* ``max_bytes`` — which it always does in
practice (a few hundred bytes per process, against a multi-MB default). Old data
is dropped as new data arrives, so recent samples always survive a rotation.
