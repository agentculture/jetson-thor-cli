"""Pure planner for the ``thor swap grow`` workflow.

This module builds an ordered, executable *plan* for resizing a file-backed
swap area (default ``/swap.img``) in place. It is a SAFETY-CRITICAL planner for
a destructive operation, so it is deliberately a **pure function**: it only
reads the caller-supplied ``state`` snapshot and returns a :class:`GrowPlan`
describing the argv steps an executor (task t5) will run. It never executes a
command, reads a file, or mutates the host itself.

The plan it emits performs an in-place resize, in this exact order::

    swapoff -> fallocate -l <bytes> -> chmod 600 -> mkswap -> swapon

On the default (permanent) path it then ensures an ``/etc/fstab`` entry so the
resized swap survives a reboot. ``--ephemeral`` (``ephemeral=True``) skips fstab
handling and warns that the change lasts only for the current boot.

It refuses (raising :class:`CliError`) rather than emitting an unsafe plan when:

* there is no file-backed swap to grow (zram-only / partition-only host) -> a
  user error (exit 1); or
* the backing filesystem lacks the free space the resize requires -> an
  environment error (exit 2).

It also surfaces the *swapoff-under-pressure* hazard as a prominent warning:
``swapoff`` must page all in-use swap back into RAM, and if that does not fit it
fails with ENOMEM and can destabilize the host. So when used swap exceeds
available RAM the plan recommends adding a second swapfile (which avoids
``swapoff``) instead of resizing in place. This is a warning, not a hard block.
