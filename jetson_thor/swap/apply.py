"""Privileged executor for a swapfile :class:`GrowPlan` — the run-as-root half.

This is the SAFETY-CRITICAL counterpart to the pure planner in
:mod:`jetson_thor.swap.grow`. The planner builds an ordered list of
destructive, privileged argv steps (``swapoff -> fallocate -> chmod -> mkswap
-> swapon``, plus an optional ``/etc/fstab`` ensure on the permanent path);
this module *executes* those steps — but only behind two hard guards:

* ``apply=False`` (the default) is a **dry run**: it runs nothing and returns a
  structured preview of the plan.
* ``apply=True`` requires **root** (``geteuid() == 0``); otherwise it runs
  nothing and raises :class:`CliError` (exit 2) with a ``sudo`` hint.

When it does run, it executes the steps strictly in order and **aborts on the
first failure**. A mid-resize abort is the whole point: if ``swapoff`` fails
(e.g. ENOMEM under memory pressure) we must NOT go on to ``fallocate`` /
``mkswap`` on the still-live swapfile. If a step fails *after* ``swapoff``
succeeded (fallocate / chmod / mkswap error or timeout), the executor first
attempts a best-effort ``swapon <swapfile>`` so the host is not left without
swap, and reports the recovery outcome in the error. Steps with an empty ``argv`` are
informational notes — recorded as not-run, never executed.

Like every domain module here it never prints and never calls ``sys.exit`` — it
raises :class:`CliError` or returns structured data, and the CLI layer renders.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plan:
        The :class:`GrowPlan` to run, as produced by
        :func:`jetson_thor.swap.grow.build_grow_plan`.
    apply:
        ``False`` (default) previews only and runs nothing. ``True`` executes
        the plan — which requires root.
    runner:
        A ``(name, args) -> (returncode, output) | None`` callable. Defaults to
        :func:`jetson_thor.probe._run.run_capture`; inject a fake in tests.
        ``None`` means the tool was absent / could not launch and is treated
        as failure.
    geteuid:
        A ``() -> int`` callable returning the effective uid. Defaults to
        :func:`os.geteuid`; inject a fake in tests to simulate root / non-root.
    diagnostic:
        Optional ``(str) -> None`` sink for progress diagnostics (the CLI passes
        its stderr emitter). Used to log the best-effort recovery ``swapon``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict

        Applied (root)::

             "executed": [{"desc", "argv", "returncode", "ran"}, ...],
             "warnings": [...]}

        In ``executed`` a note step (empty ``argv``) is recorded with
        ``ran=False`` and ``returncode=None``.

    Raises
    ------
    CliError
        With code 2 when ``apply=True`` but not root, or when a step fails
        (the plan aborts before any later step runs). If the failure happens
        after ``swapoff`` succeeded (and before the plan's own ``swapon``), a
        best-effort ``swapon <swapfile>`` recovery is attempted first and its
        outcome is included in the error.
