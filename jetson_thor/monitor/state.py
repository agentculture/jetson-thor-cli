"""Edge-triggered alert state: fire on transition, resolve on recovery.

The monitor must catch catastrophes without spamming, so it tracks which alert
keys are currently firing (persisted as JSON) and emits an event only when a key
*enters* the firing set, *leaves* it (resolved), or has been firing for
``renotify_cycles`` cycles without a fresh notification. :func:`diff` is pure.
