"""I/O contention snapshot — iowait % and blocked-process count.

Capacity probes (``memory``, ``disk``) answer *how full* the box is; this one
answers *how much it is waiting*. On the unified-memory Jetson Thor, swap
thrashing shows up as sustained ``iowait`` and a wall of D-state (blocked)
processes long before swap is "full" — the early symptom of a janky, starved
system. Both signals come from ``/proc/stat``:

* ``iowait`` is the 5th field of the aggregate ``cpu`` line, cumulative jiffies
  since boot — so a percentage needs *two* samples and a delta over the gap.
* ``procs_blocked`` is an instantaneous count, read straight from the 2nd sample.
